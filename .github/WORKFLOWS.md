## Required Secrets

The following secrets need to be configured in repository settings:

- `NPM_TOKEN` - For publishing packages to npm (required by release.yml)
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For uploading coverage reports (optional for coverage.yml)

## Required Repository Settings

### Release Workflow

For the release workflow to create pull requests automatically, you must enable:

**Repository Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions**
- ☑ Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests

For organization repositories, this must also be enabled at the organization level first.

**📖 See [RELEASE_SETUP.md](RELEASE_SETUP.md) for complete setup instructions and troubleshooting.**
