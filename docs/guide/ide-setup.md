# IDE Setup

To get the best experience developing with ObjectQL, we recommend Visual Studio Code with the following configuration.

## Visual Studio Code

We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your primary editor.

### Recommended Extensions

**1. YAML (Red Hat)**  
Essential for editing `*.object.yml` files. It provides syntax highlighting and validation.  
[Install Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)

**2. JSON (Official)**  
For editing configuration files.

## AI Assistant Configuration

ObjectQL is designed to be "AI-Native". The most efficient way to write schema and hooks is by pairing with an LLM.

We strongly recommend configuring your AI Coding Assistant (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf) with our specialized System Prompts. These prompts teach the AI about ObjectQL's metadata protocol.
