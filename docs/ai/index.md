# AI-Native Development

ObjectQL resides at the intersection of Data and Artificial Intelligence. It is designed to be "AI-Native" in two distinct ways:

1.  **For AI Agents**: It serves as the perfect structured memory system (Long-term Memory) and tool interface for AI agents.
2.  **By AI Agents**: Its metadata-driven, protocol-first architecture makes it incredibly easy for LLMs to write valid code for it.

## Overview
